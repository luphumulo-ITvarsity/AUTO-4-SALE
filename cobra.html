    <h1>About AC Cars</h1>
    <p>Like many British manufacturers, AC Cars had been using the Bristol straight-6 engine in its small-volume production, including its AC Ace two-seater roadster. The Ace had a hand-built body with a steel tube frame, and aluminium body panels that were made using English wheeling machines. The engine was a pre-World War II design by BMW which by the 1960s was considered dated.</p>
    
    <p>In September 1961, Ford provided Shelby with two engines.</p>

    <h2>AC Ace 3.6</h2>
    <p>In January 1962 mechanics at AC Cars in Thames Ditton, Surrey designed the "AC Ace 3.6" prototype with chassis number CSX2000.</p>

    <p>AC had already made most of the modifications needed for the small-block V8 when they installed the 2.6-litre (159 cu in) inline-6 Ford Zephyr engine, including the extensive rework of the AC Ace's front end bodywork.</p>

    <p>The most important modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential to handle the increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce unsprung weight was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. It was the same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.</p>

    <p>After testing and modification, the engine and transmission were removed and the chassis was air-freighted to Shelby in Los Angeles on 2 February 1962. By this time the small-block's displacement was increased to 4.7 L (289 cu in).</p>

    <p>Shelby's team paired this engine along with a transmission into CSX2000, in less than eight hours at Dean Moon's shop in Santa Fe Springs, California, and began road-testing.</p>
