            <h2>Featured Car: Mercedes-Benz W 113</h2>
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz W 113 is a two-seat roadster/coupé, introduced at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show and produced from 1963 through 1971. It replaced both the 300 SL (W 198) and the 190 SL (W 121 BII). Of the 48,912 W 113 SLs produced, 19,440 were sold in the US.</p>

            <p>The W 113 SL was developed under the auspices of Mercedes-Benz Technical Director Fritz Nallinger, Chief Engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut, and Head of Styling Friedrich Geiger, who had previously designed the iconic 500K/540K and 300 SL. The lead designers were Paul Bracq and Béla Barényi, who created its patented, slightly concave hardtop, which inspired the "Pagoda" nickname.</p>

            <p>All models were equipped with an inline-six engine with multi-port fuel injection. The bonnet, boot lid, door skins, and tonneau cover were made of aluminum to reduce weight. The comparatively short and wide chassis, combined with an excellent suspension, powerful brakes, and radial tires, gave the W 113 superb handling for its time.</p>

            <p>W 113 SLs were typically configured as a "Coupé/Roadster" with a soft-top and an optional removable hardtop. A 2+2 was introduced with the 250 SL "California Coupé," which had a fold-down rear bench seat instead of the soft-top.</p>
